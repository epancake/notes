How to Install and Configure pgAdmin to connect to Databases on Heroku

1) Download and Install pgAdmin from https://www.pgadmin.org/download/.

2) Get Heroku DB credentials.

Run heroku pg:credentials:url DATABASE_URL --app th-portal-staging
Note: For PRs, change the app
You should see heroku return a connection string. You will use values in this string to set up pgAdmin.
3) In pgAdmin, click Add Server.

Set Name to something useful, such as THStaging.
Click on the Connection tab.
Copy the host value from the Heroku connection string to the Host name field.
Copy the Port.
Copy the dbname value to the Maintenance database field.
Copy the user value to Username.
Copy the password value to Password. If you don't see the Password field here, then you will be prompted to enter it the first time you connect to the database.
Click on the SSL tab.
Set the SSL mode to Require.
Click Save.
4) Verify the connection is working. You should be able to run queries against the tables.
